# 3D-World Exploration
https://serpant.github.io/3DWorld/
This is a project to simulation a 3D World using only simple JavaScript

# Getting started

Checkout the source code:

    $ git clone https://github.com/SERPANT/3D-World.git

## Game Description

3D World is basically a 3D first person servival game. It uses the concept of perpective projection including math related to ratation and traslation to create a 3D simulation that the user can move in. The game is very stright forward the player must eat all the rotating pyramid before the life that they are given runs out which constantly decreases as time passes. The controls for movement are a little different and will take some time to get use to.Also some physics logic has been build into it like gravity and collision with other 3D objects.

## Core Logic 

The Entire game has been build using simple javascript and does not include any external library of any kind so the code is easy enough to read for anybody wanting to know how the game was build. A brief discription of this would be that it uses all the concepts that any 3D game would use.This game was constructed using 3D boxes which were made using the concept of <strong> Vector Crossproduct</strong>. So the heart of the game itself revolves around vector crossproduct and also includes the prospective projection formula that converts a 3D coordinate system to 2D coordinate system to display on the screen. Also a in depth understanding of how rotation and traslation work is very important as they play very significant role in creating the game.
